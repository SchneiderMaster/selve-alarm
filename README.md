# Welcome to Selve-Alarm

This is an app made with react-native that aims to improve and replace the use of the Shutter-Management [App by Selve](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.selve.commeo.homeserver2&hl=de).
<br> This is a submission for the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).

## Rough roadmap of features to be added:
Some features that might be added: 
* syncing shutters with alarms, so the shutter opens at the same time that the alarm goes off
* improved management of shutters and automatic opening and closing of shutters
* the app will be based using the [API](https://www.selve.de/media/03/32/2d/1627308855/Selve_Home_Server_2.postman_collection.json.zip) for the Selve Home Server 2
